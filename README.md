# calculator

A simple programming language which is just a calculator with variables and pure functions.

## Steps:
- Ensure python3 is installed (I'm using `match ... case`)
- pip3 install -r requirements.txt


## Usage:
- Write an EP program for instance, `gcd.ep`
- Compile with `./ep.py gcd.ep`
